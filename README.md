Modify 8.28 Example code to define a complete database manipulation application for the books
database. In addition to the querying, the user should be able to edit existing data and add new data
to the database. 

All your code  should be Thread safe.
Updating GUI should be only done through SwingUtilities.invokeLater or
SwingWorker.

Allow the user to edit the database in the following ways:
a) Add a new author.
b) Add a new title for an author. (Remember that the book must have an entry in the
AuthorISBN table.) Be sure to specify the publisher of the title.
c) For each of the preceding database manipulations, design an appropriate GUI to allow
the user to perform the data manipulation.
